The popular Hangman game implemented with Python Tkinter library.
The game consists of one player giving a word unknown(Europian countreas) to other player and asking him to guess it. Here the role of the first player is taken by the computer. Then as the player guesses the word based on number of letters in the word, each successful attempt makes the letter to be revealed, however if the player fails to do so and makes a wrong guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn, one after the other. If the puzzle has not been solved after 10 guesses, the player trying to guess the word has lost the game.
